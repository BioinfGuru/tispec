Title: Calculates tissue specificity from RNA-seq data
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: person("Kenneth", "Condon", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "roonysgalbi@gmail.com")
Description: Implements the TAU algorithm to calculate tissue specificity. Given RNA-seq expression data in multiple tissues, the package calculates tissue specificity of each gene for each tissue. It also performs ranking to provide a set of optimum genes with high enough specificity and expression to facilitate experimental work in the laboratory when working on a tissue or gene of interest, or to rule out contamination of a tissue by qPCR.
