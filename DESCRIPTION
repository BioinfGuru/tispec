Title: Calculates tissue specificity from RNA-seq data
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: person("Kenneth", "Condon", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "roonysgalbi@gmail.com")
Description: Implementing the TAU algorithm to calculate tissue specificity. This package takes a given a set of observations in a given set of variables. It then calculates the specificity of each observation for each variable. For example: given RNA-seq counts (rpkm/fpkm/tpm etc.) in multiple tissues, calculates tissue specificity of each gene for each tissue.
